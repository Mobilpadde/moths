## what (is this 💩)

Emojies as [TOTP](https://rublon.com/blog/hotp-totp-difference/), [because](#why-).

## why 🥲

We _all_ **could** use a little more emotion in our lives 🤗 Go show the world how you really feel!

It's a great companion for any app that uses 2FA - as every app should! Make your app's 2FA as star-striking as your app! 🤩

So whether your mascot is:

0. 🦋
1. 🐰
2. 🐶
3. 🐕
4. 🐷
5. 🐥
6. 🐱
7. 🐣
8. 🐻
9. 🐈

**moths** has got you covered! 🪰

> P.S. These emojies wasn't chosen by accident (random), they really are the 10 ut[most frequently used (animal) emojies of 2021](https://home.unicode.org/emoji/emoji-frequency/)

Show that sparkly emojies ✨

## how 🧑‍💼

Running this is quite easy 💨

0. Download the dependencies ⏬

> **Note**
>
> You can skip this step and let the `run`-command handle it - but you knew that 🧠

```sh
go mod download
```

1. Add a secret 🔐

> **Warning**
>
> This is just an one-liner to write the `base64`-encoded `sha256` of `moths` into `.env`.
> Make sure to use something better 🤷
>
> You don't need to use environment variables, this is just my choice.

```sh
echo 'moths' | sha256sum | base64 -w 0 | { echo -n "MOTHS_SECRET=$(cat -)" } > .env
```

2. Run the program 🏃

```sh
go run .
```

As I said, easy-peasy! 💖

### options 👓

To setup a new `code`-generator, you must call [`token.NewGenerator`](token/newGenerator.go#L9-L41) as

```go
gen, err := token.NewGenerator()
```

But I do recommend to add some customization, as it will fail immediately if not.

Like so

```go
gen, err := token.NewGenerator(
  token.OptionWithSecret(secret), // Any string as the secret
  token.OptionWithPeriod(time.Second), // Each code is only valid for a second
  token.OptionWithAmount(6), // Each must is always `6` emojies
  token.OptionWithEmojies(emojies.CATS), // A pure slice of cats
  token.OptionWithTime(time.Now().AddDate(10, 0, 0)), // 10 years into the future
)
```

There are a few options to choose from, these are

- [`OptionWithSecret(secret string)`](token/optionSecret.go#L9-L32)**\***
  - The secret to generate from
- [`OptionWithPeriod(period time.Duration)`](token/optionPeriod.go#L9-L18)**\***
  - On which interval should a new `code` be generated
  - A `code` will only be valid during this duration - Until (if) skewed interval are implemented
- [`OptionWithAmount(amount int)`](token/optionAmount.go#L7-L16)
  - The amount of emojies to generate in a `moth`
  - Defaults to `6`-charater tokens
- [`OptionWithEmojies(emojies emojies.Emojies)`](token/optionEmojies.go#L8-L17)**\***
  - Take a look in the [`emojies`](token/emojies)-package to see your options
  - You can also add your own emojies - [How to](#emojies-)
- [`OptionWithTime(t time.Time)`](token/optionTime.go#L5-L10)
  - This will allow you to add a custom time
  - Meaning you can validate towards old `code`s
  - You can even add future dates ⌛
  - Defaults to _now_

> **Warning**

> Options marked with an asterix (\*) are required!

### generating 🖇

Now that you have a sparkly new `code`-generator, you can use it as

```go
code, err := gen.Next()
```

Now that you have a [`code`](token/code), you can use its functions

- [`Validate(emojies string) bool`](token/code/validate.go#L3-L5)
  - Will validate a code (pattern of emojies) directly
- [`ValidateToken(token string) bool`](token/code/validate.go#L7-L10) - **_DEPRECATED_**
  - Will validate a token
  - You'll need to expose the token to your user(s) for this - not recommended
- [`String() string`](token/code/config.go#L16-L18)
  - Returns the code as a string
- [`SpacedString() string`](token/code/config.go#L20-L22)
  - Returns the code as a string with spaces inbetween
- [`Slice() []string`](token/code/config.go#L24-L26)
  - Returns the code as a slice of strings
- [`Token() string`](token/code/config.go#L37-L39) - **_DEPRECATED_**
  - Returns the token - for whatever reason that might be needed

### validating 🧑‍🔬

To validate, you'll need both the `code` (or the `token`) and the generator

```go
str := code.String() // Ideally you'd get this from the user
ok := gen.Validate(str)
```

### emojies 😻

To use your own set of **known** emojies, you can reference the [`cat`-emojies](token/emojies/cats.go).

I've chosen the `cats` as it's a great reference, both for creating and re-using.

If we would like to add an easter-egg to a purebred slice of cats, we could do it like:

```go
// A slice of cat emojies and a single hotdog 🌭
var catsHotdog = []string{
	emoji.GrinningCat.String(),
	emoji.GrinningCatWithSmilingEyes.String(),
	emoji.CatWithTearsOfJoy.String(),
	emoji.SmilingCatWithHeartEyes.String(),
	emoji.CatWithWrySmile.String(),
	emoji.KissingCat.String(),
	emoji.WearyCat.String(),
	emoji.CryingCat.String(),
	emoji.PoutingCat.String(),

	emoji.HotDog.String(),
}

var CATS_HOTDOG = ToEmojies(catsHotdog)
```

It doesn't even have to be from the [emoji](https://github.com/enescakir/emoji)-package,
simply make a slice of your desired emojies, and use the [`ToEmojies`-func](token/emojies/helper.go#L5-L19).
Then provide this as an argument in `token.OptionWithEmojies(CATS_HOTDOG)` when calling the `token.NewGenerator()`.
